2. Enter `xcode select --install`.

### Ruby Installation
1. Enter `brew install ruby` in the Terminal.
2. To check if it is correctly installed, type `which gem`. It should say `usr/local/bin/gem`. If you see this message, all is good.

### Setting up locally
1. Fork this repository.

3. Change directory to the local repository, i.e. `cd gci17.fossasia.org`. Now type `ls` to see if `Gemfile` can be seen.
4. Type `bundle install` to install dependencies.
5. Type `bundle exec jekyll serve `. You will see a Server address.
